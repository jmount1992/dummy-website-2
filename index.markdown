Hi, I am a dummy website. Time to change the theme.

1. Ignore the instructions on [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll). It will lead you astray.
2. However, we can still use any of the supported [themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/)
3. We will use the Cayman theme.
